First Way :

First of all, right after implementing the conjured item property, it is obvious that there
will be more conjured items sold at the GildedRose.
Thereby, a good idea to expand this code would be a functionnality to detect the word "Conjured"
at the beginning of an item's name, it can be a simple function which gets the all the Item's names
from the list, and calls the specific "Update_Conjured_Item" function if detected.

Second Way :

An other idea would be to display the different "rules" and patterns about each Item 
in order to let the customer have an idea about how each item is supposed to move in the next days.
In addition, as the time passes, a cool feature would be to print some graphs about the item's historical
evolution or, in other words, graphs which show how item's quality have evolved during the past days.
We would just need to store each item's quality for each day and use the c# Graphics property 
of the PrintPageEventArgs.

Third Way :

Last but not least, my last idea would be a feature which allows the user to add manually an item
to the Item's list. He would just has to enter 1 (or any other number) to open an other console 
which asks him to enter :
- The Item's name
- Its initial SellIn
- Its initial Quality
- Its quality at (Day - 1) when (SellIn > 0)
- Its quality at (Day - 1) when (SellIn < 0)
