1. What is this code about?

Basically, this code creates and displays items that are being sold in a place named the Guilded Rose during 30 days.
(Items from WoW, I have recognized Sulfuras, the Hand of Ragnaros)
On the console, it is also displaying a few informations such as the item's names, their expiration date and also their quality.

2. Can you clearly identify the name of all the goods stored in the Guilded Rose?

After running the code, the name of all the goods stored in the Guilded Rose are : 
- +5 Dexterity Vest
- Aged Brie
- Elixir of the Mongoose
- 3x Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros
- 3x Backstage passes to a TAFKAL80ETC concert
- Conjured Mana Cake


3. What happens when the day is over?

When the day is over, the quality of the several items can change.

4. What happens to cheese when the day is over?

At the opposite of the majority of the other's items, the cheese's quality increase when the day is over.
We can make a comparison with real cheese, which usually become "better" as the time passes.

5. What happens when a concert ticket goes over its expiration day?

Considering that a concert ticket is meant to be used for one specific date, when the expiration date is reached, its quality goes to 0.

6. What makes this code hard to read?

There are an important amount of conditions, especially if statements.

7. Do you think the rules are clear enough so that you could rework the entire solution from scratch?

I guess we will see in a few hours. :)))
